# N2P-CSS-Grid
Code produced during the CSS Grid N2P
Each episode is a different branch!

# Requirements
In order to understand this series, you'll need to know a little HTML and the basics of CSS, I'll go over each concept one at a time to make sure it's not too confusing.

# One video per branch
You can go through all the branches to check the code relative to the video, try to follow on your own and code the layout you want to achieve. The best learning tool is practice.

# Why you should care to learn CSS Grids

## Pros

 - One of the best tools to design either static or dynamic layouts
 - Really easy to begin with and yet powerful enough to do most layouts (more on that later)
 - Works very well in tandem with media queries and as some native responsive features as well
 - Helps keep your HTML semantic by limiting the need of using containers to style your layout
 - Streamline the process of Refactoring your UI later on

 ## Cons

 - Not suited for layouts that don't fit in a 2D grid, like the masonry style
 - Not suited for non-rectangular shapes, You can make it work but other technics might be more useful in that case
